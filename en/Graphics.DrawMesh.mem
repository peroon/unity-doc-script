Draw a mesh.
DrawMesh draws a mesh for one frame. The mesh will be affected by the lights, can cast and receive shadows and be
affected by Projectors - just like it was part of some game object. It can be drawn for all cameras or just for
some specific camera.

Use DrawMesh in situations where you want to draw large amount of meshes, but don't want the overhead of creating and
managing game objects. Note that DrawMesh does not draw the mesh immediately; it merely "submits" it for rendering. The mesh
will be rendered as part of normal rendering process. If you want to draw a mesh immediately, use Graphics.DrawMeshNow.

Because DrawMesh does not draw mesh immediately, modifying material properties between calls to this function won't make
the meshes pick up them. If you want to draw series of meshes with the same material, but slightly different
properties (e.g. change color of each mesh), use [[MaterialPropertyBlock]] parameter.

SA: [[MaterialPropertyBlock]].
CONVERTEXAMPLE
BEGIN EX
	// Draws aMesh with aMaterial at (0,0,0) with no rotation for one frame

	var aMesh : Mesh;
	var aMaterial : Material;

	function Update() {
		Graphics.DrawMesh(aMesh, Vector3.zero, Quaternion.identity, aMaterial, 0);
	}

@param mesh The [[Mesh]] to draw.
@param position Position of the mesh.
@param rotation Rotation of the mesh.
@param matrix Transformation matrix of the mesh (combines position, rotation and other transformations).
@param material [[Material]] to use.
@param layer [[wiki:Layers|Layer]] to use.
@param camera If /null/ (default), the mesh will be drawn in all cameras. Otherwise it will be rendered in the given camera only.
@param submeshIndex Which subset of the mesh to draw. This applies only to meshes that are composed of several materials.
@param properties Additional material properties to apply onto material just before this mesh will be drawn. See [[MaterialPropertyBlock]].
